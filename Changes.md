  - `readData()` now reads 15 bytes instead of 16.

  - Seems like the `fastReadData()` function has issues.
  - Instances of `fastReadData()` are now replaced with `readData()`.

#

  - Now uses `fastReadData()` everywhere to read single touch points.
  - Uses `tempData` to convert the touch data to the CSE_TouchPoint data type.
  - Due to a bug, the returned touch data is garbage.

### **+05:30 07:34:53 PM 28-03-2025, Friday**

  - Removed all redundant touch point data variables.
  - Added `fastReadData()` that will only read the specified touch point.
